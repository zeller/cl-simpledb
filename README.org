* Overview

This is a project folder for my attempt to implement some of the
phases of the cs222 project in Common Lisp.

* Progress

- [X] Phase 1 - Record Management and Buffering
- [X] Phase 2 - Indexing
- [ ] Phase 3 - Relational Operators
 - Finished filter
- [ ] Phase 4 - Query Optimization

See description of phases at [[https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/asterix/wiki/cs222-2010-winter-SimpleDBProjectInfo][CS222 Project Page]].

* Compiling

** Prerequisites

=sbcl= including =flexi-streams= and =cl-ppcre=.

To install the prerequisites, first install =sbcl=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install sbcl
#+END_SRC

Start up =sbcl= as =root=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo sbcl
#+END_SRC

and enter the following code to get =flexi-streams= and =cl-ppcre=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'asdf-install)

;; you will most likely want to do a system install
;; ignore any GPG signature warnings
(asdf-install:install 'flexi-streams) ;; in-memory binary streams
(asdf-install:install 'cl-ppcre)      ;; pearl regular expressions
#+END_SRC

Additionally, I highly recommended SLIME for Emacs, although it is not
necessary for compiling the code.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install slime
#+END_SRC

** Compile

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./compile.lisp
#+END_SRC

This will create the binary =simpledb=.

* Usage

Use the provided =test.txt= file to create an example database file,
add and remove a few tuples, and dump the output to *standard-output*.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./simpledb test int,int
./simpledb test string,string
./simpledb test int,string
./simpledb test string,int
#+END_SRC
